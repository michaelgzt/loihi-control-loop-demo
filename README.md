# Robotic control loop with Intel's Loihi chip

This package contains the control-loop demo that shows how to interact with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on 
Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip during runtime for real-time robotic control.

## Software Installation ##

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Python 3.5.2
- NxSDK 0.9

Intel's neuromorphic library NxSDK is only required for SNN deployment on the Loihi neuromorphic chip. 
If you are interested in deploying SNN on Loihi, please contact the [Intel Neuromorphic Lab](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-community.html).

## Example Usage ##

To simplify the network structure, the demo defines a 2-layer SNN with the 5 neurons in the input layer and 5 neurons in the output layer. 
Neurons in the output layer copy the spike activities from the input layer by using one-to-one connections.
We demonstrate 3 different ways to interact with the SNN on Loihi:

1. (1 Control Iteration = 1 Loihi step) Inject spikes to the input layer. Record spikes from the output layer.

2. (1 Control Iteration = 10 Loihi steps) Inject current to Loihi and generate spikes for the input layer using Integrate-and-Fire neurons.
Record the number of spikes from the output layer.

3. (1 Control Iteration = 100 Loihi steps) Inject spike probability to Loihi and generate Poisson spikes for the input layer.
Record the number of spikes from the output layer.

More details on how to use the demo can be found in this ipython notebook.
